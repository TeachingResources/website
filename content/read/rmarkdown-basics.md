- **[Reports with RMarkdown](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-r-markdown)** (by Garrett Grolemund)

_Focus is on chapter 1 and chapter 2, though aside from a few hints most of this is self-explanatory.  Feel free to check out chapters 3 and 4 for more information on some of the other output formats and advanced features of RMarkdown.  Please note that we will mostly be using the `github_document` format and not the `html_document` format._
