## Overview

Many of the greatest challenges we face today come from understanding and interacting with the natural world: from global climate change to the sudden collapse of fisheries and forests, from the spread of disease and invasive species to the unknown wealth of medical, cultural, and technological value we derive from nature. Advances in satellites and micro-sensors, computation, informatics and the Internet have made available unprecedented amounts of data about the natural world, and with it, new challenges of sifting, processing and synthesizing large and diverse sources of information. 

In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of modern data science, computing, statistics and modeling to leading questions in ecology and environmental science. Students will master R programming techniques, relational database fundamentals, data management, version control, working with remote data and REST APIs, collaborative and reproducible research practices and workflow while analyzing issues pertaining to topics such as global climate change, ecological population dynamics, fisheries collapse and mass extinctions.

## Approach

This course will use a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) model, with new material
introduced in reading assignments prior to class while class time will
focus on applying these skills to explore interesting data sets. We
will move though four modules, each introducing a new data set and
new scientific questions, while also introducing a new skill area and 
building on previous skills. Students will be expected to work collaboratively
in and out of class, and course content and grading will emphasize
communication and reproducibility of an analysis as much as scientific
or technical completeness.  The [Course Syllabus](/syllabus/)
provides an overview of the modules and topics covered as well as links
to weekly reading, assignments, and any lecture material.  This syllabus
is preliminary and always subject to change.

## Texts

We will use [Grolemund and Wickham's *R For Data Science*](http://amzn.to/2aHLAQ1) 
as the primary text for this course. A hard copy of the book is not
required and the openly licensed full text can be found on the [author's website for this book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

Students will also be referred to sections in [Wickham's *Advanced R*](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) for more on 
fundamentals of R programming, as well as various other references as necessary.
